# Valiant Utilities

## This Bot has unfortunately has reached it's end of service due to me running out of money to host it :(

(Formerly [Chad Bot](https://github.com/ValiantWind/Chad-Bot))
(Move repositories due to the [previous one](https://github.com/ValiantWind/Chad-Bot being corrupted.)

A Multipurpose Discord Bot coded with Discord.js with various different commands.

Open source as of 7/15/2022

Features:
- Uses Slash Commands
- A Full Moderation System
- Lots of Fun Commands
- Lots of Informational Commands
- Some Roblox Commmands
 
 ***

What makes this Discord bot different from the rest is that it has absolutely no paywall. 

Everything feature, is, and always will be, free. I didn't make this bot to profit off of it. I made it with my freetime to make people who use it happy that they can use every single feature on this bot without paying anything.

It has 24/7 hosting, and I plan to get it verified when, or if, it reaches 75 servers. I hope this bot is useful to a lot of people.

Of course, donations are always appreciated (hosting is expensive), but this bot will always be 100% free. No catch.

A few things to note:

- You might notice occasionally that the bot appearing offline and online and offline. Its because I'm restarting the bot to test new commands or apply changes.
